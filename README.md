# What does this application do?
TunnlTo is a tool for controlling which Windows applications, processes, and IP addresses can use a WireGuard VPN tunnel.

## Example use cases
* Route only FireFox through a privacy VPN
* Route Slack and Microsoft Office through a work VPN
* Route a game through a gaming VPN
* Stop a game from routing through a privacy VPN
* Stop a browser from routing through a work VPN
* Route a specific IP address range through a privacy VPN
* Route all traffic through a privacy VPN except a specific IP address range

# How does it work?
TunnlTo is built in collaboration with the creator of [WireSock](https://www.wiresock.net/). TunnlTo 'wraps' the WireSock CLI application to provide a simple user interface for enhanced accessibility. WireSock is currently closed source and an open source version is being considered.

> WireSock VPN Client is a lightweight command line WireGuard VPN client for Windows that has advanced features not available in the official WireGuard for Windows such as selective application tunneling and disallowed IP addresses.
>
>WireSock VPN Client combines the power of Windows Packet Filter and BoringTun (user space WireGuard implementation in Rust) to provide exceptional performance, security and scalability.

# Example Configurations
These examples show the use of optional parameters. The required parameters such as private key, public key etc. are not shown. If you would like an example added, please open a [discussion](https://github.com/TunnlTo/desktop-app/discussions).

## Route a specific app through a tunnel
### Scenario
You utilise a privacy VPN to protect your privacy when browsing the internet. You want to use the privacy VPN when browsing the internet with FireFox and when torrenting, but you do not want to use the privacy VPN for any other applications.

### Expected Outcome
In this example, FireFox and qBittorrent are routed through the WireGuard tunnel while all other applications are routed through the default network adapter. DNS requests from FireFox and qBittorrent will route through the tunnel and use the DNS servers specified.

### Configuration
- DNS: `1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8`
- Allowed Apps: `firefox, qBittorrent`
- Allowed IP's: `0.0.0.0/0`

## Route all traffic through a tunnel except specific apps
### Scenario
You utilise a company VPN to access your employers servers. You want the Chrome browser traffic to route through your default network adapter so it will:
- Not be tracked by your employer
- Not overload the company VPN bandwidth when watching videos, downloading files etc.

### Expected Outcome
In this example, all traffic is routed through the WireGuard tunnel except Chrome.

### Configuration
- DNS: `1.1.1.1, 8.8.8.8`
- Disallowed Apps: `chrome`
- Allowed IP's: `0.0.0.0/0`

## Route all apps in a specific folder through a a tunnel
### Scenario
You utilise a company VPN to access your employers servers. You want all of your work applications that are installed in a specific folder to route through your company VPN so that they:
- Work correctly with your companies servers
- Follows your company policies

### Expected Outcome
In this example, all apps in the `C:\Work Apps\` folder are routed through the WireGuard tunnel. The company DNS server is used for DNS requests.

### Configuration
- DNS: `10.64.0.1`
- Allowed Apps: `C:\Work Apps\`
- Allowed IP's: `0.0.0.0/0`

## Route a specific IP address range when used by a specific app through a tunnel
### Scenario
You want to access a company intranet when using the Edge browser, otherwise it should use your normal network adapter.

### Expected Outcome
In this example, an IP address range is routed through the WireGuard tunnel when the the IP range is accessed by the Edge browser. Otherwise, all Edge browser traffic is routed through the default network adapter. Note that in this example the DNS parameter is not set, so the default DNS server will be used by Edge. If the DNS parameter was set to the company DNS server, all Edge DNS requests would route through the tunnel to the company DNS server.

### Configuration
- Allowed Apps: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application\msedge.exe`
- Allowed IP's: `10.0.0.0/64`

## Route a specific IP address and/or IP address range through a tunnel
### Scenario
You want to access company servers through a company VPN server, however all other traffic should use your default network adapter.

### Expected Outcome
In this example, an IP address and IP range are routed through the WireGuard tunnel for all applications. All other traffic is routed through the default network adapter.

### Configuration
- Allowed IP's: `200.200.200.200, 10.10.10.0/24`

## Disallow a specific IP address and IP address range from using a tunnel
### Scenario
You want to use a privacy VPN service for all network traffic except some specific IP addresses and IP address ranges.

### Expected Outcome
In this example, an IP address and IP range are routed through the default network adapter and NOT the tunnel. All other traffic is routed through the WireGuard tunnel.

### Configuration
- Allowed IP's: `0.0.0.0/0`
- Disallowed IP's: `200.200.200.200, 10.10.10.0/24`

## Route a specific app through a tunnel except for a specific IP address range
### Scenario
You utilise an overseas VPN server for faster ping times to an overseas region in Counter Strike. You also still play on local servers and do not want to have to enable/disable the VPN depending on what servers you're playing on.

### Expected Outcome
Counter Strike traffic is routed through the WireGuard tunnel except for when a specific IP address range is accessed by the game. In this case the IP range would be the local servers.

### Configuration
- Allowed Apps: `csgo`
- Allowed IP's: `0.0.0.0/0`
- Disallowed IP's: `12.34.45.0/24`
